# @react-grab/openstory

Internal playground for React Grab's overlay UI.

Renders the full `ReactGrabRenderer` against mocked states and realistic playground pages, so overlay states can be inspected without running the e2e app.

Uses [openstory](https://openstory.dev), a Vite-native CSF 3 alternative to Storybook.

## Develop

```bash
# Build the core CSS once (required before first run)
pnpm --filter react-grab prebuild

# Start openstory
pnpm --filter @react-grab/openstory dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:6006`.

## Build

```bash
pnpm --filter @react-grab/openstory build
```

Static build output is written to `dist/` and deployed to <https://openstory.react-grab.dev>.

## Two kinds of stories

**Component stories** render toolbar, selection label, context menu, comments dropdown, and renderer states with mocked props. Use these to inspect specific UI states such as idle, context menu, comment input, and pending dismiss.

**Playground stories** import `react-grab` for its side effect, so `init()` runs against the story DOM. Use these for ad-hoc hover and grab testing against realistic fixtures:

- **Composite Dashboard** - sidebar, metric cards, chart, and data table for dense-DOM selection testing
- **Freeze Demo** - bouncing animated timer for verifying freeze-animations + freeze-updates
- **Live Updates** - continuously re-rendering components for freeze-updates verification
